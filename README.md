This is a peer comparison project. Suppose that you are
working for Samsung in customer experience management
team. The idea is to regularly monitor the customer
satisfaction levels and peer company moves. The competitor
company is Apple. The objective is to test two main
hypothesis.
1. The Samsung Average customer satisfaction score is
minimum 75%.
2. The overall average satisfaction score of Samsung is same
as Apple. There is no significant difference in the satisfaction
scores
â€¢ It might be possible that both hypothesis are correct, one
of them is correct or both of them are wrong. Perform the
relevant testing to verify these assumptions
The data is collected for 100 Samsung customers and 100
Apple customers. Their satisfaction scores are recorded. The
sample represent the data and it is unbiased.
